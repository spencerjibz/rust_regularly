The repo features my weekly usage and learning in rust including: 
- Solutions to Katas from coderwars
- Translations from other languages to rust(mainly Javascript)
- Some Trial algorithms with tests 

### Requirments
- All versions of rust edition 2018
 - For some,  the nightly tool chain may be needed

- Clone the repo using git (check my other repos for instructions on how to );
- Use using `cargo run or cargo build` to platform dependent binaries. Use the release flag (`Rust cargo run --release `) for optimized builds
